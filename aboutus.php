<p>Taekwondo is a martial art created in Korea in the 1950s.</p>

<p>It is a style based on the indigenous Korean martial art Taekgyeon with a strong influence from the Japanese martial art Karate. The dynamic kicking techniques are derived from Taekgyeon while the linear hand techniques and forms resemble Karate. Whereas Taekgyeon employs circular and rhythmic hand movement as well as throwing and tripping techniques to take one&rsquo;s partner to the ground softly.</p>

<p>At HMD Academy, the beauty of the body&#39;s movement holds a higher importance to our practice than the effectiveness of striking a partner.</p>

<h3>The HMD Difference</h3>

<p>At our Academy, each student is treated individually, by instructors who are trained to gauge a person&#39;s progress by his or her own abilities. In this way, all students achieve according to their own scale and develop confidence as they meet their own goals.</p>

<p>All HMD instructors have undergone an extensive training program emphasizing the philosophy of Moo Do, or the Art of Living. Our focus is clearly on using Taekwondo and Taekgyeon to help students learn to overcome obstacles, both internal and external. Through the training that the HMD Academy offers, students have accomplished many significant personal and professional goals and objectives.</p>

<p>HMD stands for Hyong Moo Do. For a more complete explanation of the philosophy of Moo Do Taekwondo, see Master Namsoo Hyong&#39;s paper, Understanding Taekwondo as an Art.</p>
